# MRS Team 26 - Pekari

This repository contains the project for MRS.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified GitFlow-like branching strategy:

- **main**: Contains the latest stable release. Code is merged here from `develop` when a release is ready.
- **develop**: The primary integration branch for development. All features should be merged here.
- **feature/...**: Feature branches for individual tasks or stories. Create them from `develop` (e.g., `feature/login-page`, `feature/api-service`).

## Project Structure

- `web/`: Angular frontend application.
- `backend/`: Backend service (to be initialized).
- `mobile/`: Mobile application (to be initialized).

## Getting Started

Refer to the `README.md` in each subdirectory for specific instructions.
